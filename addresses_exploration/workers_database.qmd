## Introduction

Mining the History of Holyoke (STAT210) is a class at Amherst College with a mission statement of curating and publishing a piece of Holyoke's history and making it accessible to the town's people. One way our class has begun this journey is by analyzing and curating an old payroll registry found in an attic in Holyoke and now available in the archives of the Holyoke Public Library History Room. This register tracked pay for employees who worked at the Parsons Paper Mill in Holyoke, Massachusetts (the "Paper City") in the 1860s. It has been remarkable to track down so much history as each page of this nearly 400 page registry has upwards of 30 employees, and each name has its own story worth telling. In the registry, we can see one's name, number of days worked, their wages, whether or not the worker had rent or board due, the final balance owed, and signature (see @fig-sample1). Click [here](https://r.amherst.edu/apps/nhorton/Parsons-Paper/) for an interactive display of the register.

## Workers' Summary

We took on the task of finding information about some of the employees at the paper mill using the database Ancestry.com. On page 259, we found two women with the same last name which was common back then but still we decided to search for one of them on Ancestry.com. Their names were Lucy and E.A. Allen. When we searched for Lucy, we found that E.A. stood for Eliza Ann Allen--they were sisters! (see @fig-sample2). Lucy was born in Massachusetts in 1842 and Eliza Ann was her older sister born in 1841. They lived in dwelling 42. Their father's name was Job Allen and their mother was Anna Allen. Job was born in England and moved to the United States sometime before 1841. Like his daughters, he too worked at the Parsons Paper Company. We found record of him first on page 3. (see @fig-sample3). Anna Allen stayed at home. This was a common life for a working-class family in Holyoke, Massachusetts in the 1860s. From what we were able to gather, Eliza and Lucy were finishers meaning they helped with finalizing the paper making process. We made this assumption when we found Lucy's name on Page 2 under the label "Finishers." See (@fig-sample4). Eliza and Lucy were paid not by the number of hours or days they worked but rather the number of reams they finished. We can see on page on page 2 that Lucy finished 756 reams of paper for the month of January in 1861. Eliza's name first appeared in 1862 on page 34 right below her sisters name, one year after her sister first started working. (see @fig-sample5). Coincidentally, they were one year apart in age. Perhaps their father Job did not want his daughters to work until they were 20 years of age. It seemed that the Allen family had trouble finding a permanent residence as we found a number of addresses reported across different resources. In 1869, the Holyoke city directory shows that the Allen family lived on Dwight Street. Ancestry.com showed that the Allen family lived in dwelling 42 with no street name reported in 1870. (see @fig-sample6). We were able to follow Lucy's places of residence in several years after 1870 until her death on May 11, 1893 in Holyoke, MA. See @fig-sample7 for Lucy's places of residence. It is also worth noting that Lucy, Eliza, and Job worked for roughly the entire decade at the mill suggesting the daughters were not pursuing any form of education in this period. Lucy also appears to have continued working in the PPC mill until her death. It is difficult to determine if the Allen family's literacy due to inconsistencies in signatures. Some signatures have "X" in them while others do not, and the handwriting is different across the decade suggesting they multiple people could have been signing for them.

Conversely, we were able to find records on Joseph C. Parsons; the founder of the Parsons Paper Company. (see @fig-sample8). Born on February 6, 1814, in Northampton, Hampshire County, Massachusetts to Lydia and Justice Parsons, Joseph Clark Parsons was a local businessman who became very successful after founding his mill. He married Lucretia Hoyt Parsons and had three daughters; Catherine Turner Taft, Fannie Colton Parsons, and Elizabeth Hoyt Parsons. We found that Parsons lived in house 22 of dwelling 165 on Suffolk street which was quite close to his Mill. This was surprising because we expected him to live in the upper-class district because wealthier people lived in hills above sea level. If we continued our research, we would aim to find descendants of the Parsons Paper Company that are still living today.

## Database

Here is the database we created. It displays personal information about Parson's Paper employees. We can find who they are, when they were born, their address, family members, and place of origin. Naturally, with data this old, we could not find each and every piece of information for all of the employees. This is just a start that will hopefully fuel other individuals to contribute to this document. If we had extended time and resources, we would search up more employees on Ancestry.com and try and find their living descendants today. For this project, we were only able to access basic information on Ancestry.com. It would be great to access the full database and find more documentation of the employees as each additional document provides more information about someone's life that we might not have had before. The table shown below shows some of the columns of the data set. More information is viewable in the full spreadsheet. This is the aggregated info for some of the workers who worked in Parsons' paper in the 1860s:

## **Technical Appendix**

The goal of this technical appendix is to provide a repeatable procedure of our process of collecting the information from Ancestry.com so that other passionate historians can build off our work. First, we accessed the Amherst College Library account for Ancestry.com.

```{r, out.height="30%"}
#| label: fig-sample9
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "Once on the Amherst website, we clicked the link to Ancestry Library Edition"
knitr::include_graphics("amherst_website.png")
```

The link to Amherst's access to ancestry website is [here](https://libguides.amherst.edu/c.php?g=944984&p=6812570).

Here is how the ancestry website looks at a first glance:

```{r, out.height="32.5%"}
#| label: fig-sample10
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "Ancestry.com 'search' screen"
knitr::include_graphics("website.jpeg")
```

By searching for a name and a place, (Holyoke, Hampden, Massachusetts), we were able to find census information from the 1800s and track down paper mill workers.

The are a number of names that appear in first search. We used educated guesses to select the most appropriate person looking at dates of birth and death, places lived, and any other information that might've given us a clue.

```{r, out.height="33%"}
#| label: fig-sample11
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "Initial search results"
knitr::include_graphics("multiple_names.jpeg")
```

The amount of information we could find on each worker varied from name to name but in general, we were able to find birth year, birthplace, spouse, children, parents, occupation, and address. Here is what Eliza Ann's profile looks like on Ancestry.com. We then compiled these results into this table\ref{table}.

```{r, out.width="50%"}
#| label: fig-sample12
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "Eliza Ann Allen's Profile (1841-?)"
knitr::include_graphics("ELIZA_ANN.png")
```

```{r, out.width="70%"}
#| label: fig-sample13
#| echo: false
