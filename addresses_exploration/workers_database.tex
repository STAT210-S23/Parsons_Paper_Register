\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Mining the History of Holyoke (STAT210) is a class at Amherst College
with a mission statement of curating and publishing a piece of Holyoke's
history and making it accessible to the town's people. One way our class
has begun this journey is by analyzing and curating an old payroll
registry found in an attic in Holyoke and now available in the archives
of the Holyoke Public Library History Room. This register tracked pay
for employees who worked at the Parsons Paper Mill in Holyoke,
Massachusetts (the ``Paper City'') in the 1860s. It has been remarkable
to track down so much history as each page of this nearly 400 page
registry has upwards of 30 employees, and each name has its own story
worth telling. In the registry, we can see one's name, number of days
worked, their wages, whether or not the worker had rent or board due,
the final balance owed, and signature (see Figure~\ref{fig-sample1}).

an interactive display of the register.

\subsection{Workers' Summary}\label{workers-summary}}

We took on the task of finding information about some of the employees
at the paper mill using the database Ancestry.com. On page 259, we found
two women with the same last name which was common back then but still
we decided to search for one of them on Ancestry.com. Their names were
Lucy and E.A. Allen. When we searched for Lucy, we found that E.A. stood
for Eliza Ann Allen--they were sisters! (see Figure~\ref{fig-sample2}).
Lucy was born in Massachusetts in 1842 and Eliza Ann was her older
sister born in 1841. They lived in dwelling 42. Their father's name was
Job Allen and their mother was Anna Allen. Job was born in England and
moved to the United States sometime before 1841. Like his daughters, he
too worked at the Parsons Paper Company. We found record of him first on
page 3. (see Figure~\ref{fig-sample3}). Anna Allen stayed at home. This
was a common life for a working-class family in Holyoke, Massachusetts
in the 1860s. From what we were able to gather, Eliza and Lucy were
finishers meaning they helped with finalizing the paper making process.
We made this assumption when we found Lucy's name on Page 2 under the
label ``Finishers.'' See (Figure~\ref{fig-sample4}). Eliza and Lucy were
paid not by the number of hours or days they worked but rather the
number of reams they finished. We can see on page on page 2 that Lucy
finished 756 reams of paper for the month of January in 1861. Eliza's
name first appeared in 1862 on page 34 right below her sisters name, one
year after her sister first started working. (see
Figure~\ref{fig-sample5}). Coincidentally, they were one year apart in
age. Perhaps their father Job did not want his daughters to work until
they were 20 years of age. It seemed that the Allen family had trouble
finding a permanent residence as we found a number of addresses reported
across different resources. In 1869, the Holyoke city directory shows
that the Allen family lived on Dwight Street. Ancestry.com showed that
the Allen family lived in dwelling 42 with no street name reported in
1870. (see Figure~\ref{fig-sample6}). We were able to follow Lucy's
places of residence in several years after 1870 until her death on May
11, 1893 in Holyoke, MA. See Figure~\ref{fig-sample7} for Lucy's places
of residence. It is also worth noting that Lucy, Eliza, and Job worked
for roughly the entire decade at the mill suggesting the daughters were
not pursuing any form of education in this period. Lucy also appears to
have continued working in the PPC mill until her death. It is difficult
to determine if the Allen family's literacy due to inconsistencies in
signatures. Some signatures have ``X'' in them while others do not, and
the handwriting is different across the decade suggesting they multiple
people could have been signing for them.

Conversely, we were able to find records on Joseph C. Parsons; the
founder of the Parsons Paper Company. (see Figure~\ref{fig-sample8}).
Born on February 6, 1814, in Northampton, Hampshire County,
Massachusetts to Lydia and Justice Parsons, Joseph Clark Parsons was a
local businessman who became very successful after founding his mill. He
married Lucretia Hoyt Parsons and had three daughters; Catherine Turner
Taft, Fannie Colton Parsons, and Elizabeth Hoyt Parsons. We found that
Parsons lived in house 22 of dwelling 165 on Suffolk street which was
quite close to his Mill. This was surprising because we expected him to
live in the upper-class district because wealthier people lived in hills
above sea level. If we continued our research, we would aim to find
descendants of the Parsons Paper Company that are still living today.

\subsection{Database}\label{database}}

Here is the database we created. It displays personal information about
Parson's Paper employees. We can find who they are, when they were born,
their address, family members, and place of origin. Naturally, with data
this old, we could not find each and every piece of information for all
of the employees. This is just a start that will hopefully fuel other
individuals to contribute to this document. If we had extended time and
resources, we would search up more employees on Ancestry.com and try and
find their living descendants today. For this project, we were only able
to access basic information on Ancestry.com. It would be great to access
the full database and find more documentation of the employees as each
additional document provides more information about someone's life that
we might not have had before. The table shown below shows some of the
columns of the data set. More information is viewable in the full
spreadsheet. This is the aggregated info for some of the workers who
worked in Parsons' paper in the 1860s:

Appendix}}{Technical Appendix}}\label{technical-appendix}}

The goal of this technical appendix is to provide a repeatable procedure
of our process of collecting the information from Ancestry.com so that
other passionate historians can build off our work. First, we accessed
the Amherst College Library account for Ancestry.com.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.3\textheight]{amherst_website.png}

The link to Amherst's access to ancestry website is
\href{https://libguides.amherst.edu/c.php?g=944984\&p=6812570}{here}.

Here is how the ancestry website looks at a first glance:

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.325\textheight]{website.jpeg}

}

\caption{\label{fig-sample10}Ancestry.com `search' screen}

\end{figure}

By searching for a name and a place, (Holyoke, Hampden, Massachusetts),
we were able to find census information from the 1800s and track down
paper mill workers.

The are a number of names that appear in first search. We used educated
guesses to select the most appropriate person looking at dates of birth
and death, places lived, and any other information that might've given
us a clue.

}

\caption{\label{fig-sample11}Initial search results}

\end{figure}

The amount of information we could find on each worker varied from name
to name but in general, we were able to find birth year, birthplace,
spouse, children, parents, occupation, and address. Here is what Eliza
Ann's profile looks like on Ancestry.com. We then compiled these results
into a spreadsheet linked above.
