\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Mining the History of Holyoke (STAT210) is a class at Amherst College
with a mission statement of curating and publishing a piece of Holyoke's
history and making it accessible to the town's people. One way our class
has begun this journey is by analyzing an old payroll registry found in
an attic in Holyoke and now available in the archives of the Holyoke
Public Library History Room. This register tracked pay for employees who
worked at the Parsons Paper Mill in Holyoke, Massachusetts (the ``Paper
City'') in the 1860s. It has been remarkable to track down so much
history as each page of this nearly 400 page registry has upwards of 30
names, and each name has its own story worth telling. In the registry,
we can see one's name, number of days worked, their wages, whether or
not the worker had rent or board due, the final balance owed, and
signature (see Figure~\ref{fig-sample1}). See
\href{https://r.amherst.edu/apps/nhorton/Parsons-Paper/}{here} for an
interactive display of the register.

\hypertarget{workers-summary}{%
\subsection{Workers' Summary}\label{workers-summary}}

We took on the task of finding information about some of the employees
at the paper mill using the database Ancestry.com. On page 259, we found
two women with the same last name which was common back then but still
we decided to search for one of them on Ancestry.com. Their names were
Lucy and E.A. Allen. When we searched for Lucy, we found that E.A. stood
for Eliza Ann Allen--they were sisters! (see Figure~\ref{fig-sample2}).
Lucy was born in Massachusetts in 1842 and Eliza Ann was her older
sister born in 1841. They lived in dwelling 42. Their father's name was
Job Allen and their mother was Anna Allen. Job was born in England and
moved to the United States sometime before 1841. Like his daughters, he
too worked at the Parsons Paper Company. We found record of him first on
page 3. (see Figure~\ref{fig-sample3}). Anna Allen stayed at home. This
was a common life for a working-class family in Holyoke, Massachusetts
in the 1860s. From what we were able to gather, Eliza and Lucy were
finishers meaning they helped with finalizing the paper making process.
We made this assumption when we found Lucy's name on Page 2 under the
label ``Finishers.'' See (Figure~\ref{fig-sample4}). Eliza and Lucy were
paid not by the number of hours or days they worked but rather the
number of reams they finished. We can see on page on page 2 that Lucy
finished 756 reams of paper for the month of January in 1861. Eliza's
name first appeared in 1862 on page 34 right below her sisters name, one
year after her sister first started working. (see
Figure~\ref{fig-sample5}). Coincidentally, they were one year apart in
age. Perhaps their father Job did not want his daughters to work until
they were 20 years of age. It seemed that the Allen family had trouble
finding a permanent residence as we found a number of addresses reported
across different resources. In 1869, the Holyoke city directory shows
that the Allen family lived on Dwight Street. Ancestry.com showed that
the Allen family lived in dwelling 42 with no street name reported in
1870. (see Figure~\ref{fig-sample6}). We were able to follow Lucy's
places of residence in several years after 1870 until her death on May
11, 1893 in Holyoke, MA. See Figure~\ref{fig-sample7} for Lucy's places
of residence. It is also worth noting that Lucy, Eliza, and Job worked
for roughly the entire decade at the mill suggesting the daughters were
not pursuing any form of education in this period. Lucy also appears to
have continued working in the PPC mill until her death. It is difficult
to determine if the Allen family's literacy due to inconsistencies in
signatures. Some signatures have ``X'' in them while others do not, and
the handwriting is different across the decade suggesting they multiple
people could have been signing for them.

\newpage{}

Conversely, we were able to find records on Joseph C. Parsons; the
founder of the Parsons Paper Company. (see Figure~\ref{fig-sample8}).
Born on February 6, 1814, in Northampton, Hampshire County,
Massachusetts to Lydia and Justice Parsons, Joseph Clark Parsons was a
local businessman who became very successful after founding his mill. He
married Lucretia Hoyt Parsons and had three daughters; Catherine Turner
Taft, Fannie Colton Parsons, and Elizabeth Hoyt Parsons. We found that
Parsons lived in house 22 of dwelling 165 on Suffolk street which was
quite close to his Mill. This was surprising because we expected him to
live in the upper-class district because wealthier people lived in hills
above sea level. If we continued our research, we would aim to find
descendants of the Parsons Paper Company that are still living today.

Here is a
\href{https://github.com/STAT210-S23/Parsons_Paper_Register}{LINK} to
this repo \#\# \textbf{Technical Appendix}

First, we accessed the Amherst College Library account for Ancestry.com.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.3\textheight]{amherst_website.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-sample9}Once on the Amherst website, we clicked the
link to Ancestry Library Edition}

\end{figure}

The link to Amherst's access to ancestry website is
\href{https://libguides.amherst.edu/c.php?g=944984\&p=6812570}{here}.

Here is how the ancestry website looks at a first glance:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.325\textheight]{website.jpeg}

}

\caption{\label{fig-sample10}Ancestry.com `search' screen}

\end{figure}

By searching for a name and a place, (Holyoke, Hampden, Massachusetts),
we were able to find census information from the 1800s and track down
paper mill workers.

The number of names that appear in first search. We used educated
guesses to select the most appropriate person.

}

\caption{\label{fig-sample11}Initial search results}

\end{figure}

The amount of information we could find on each worker varied from name
to name but in general, we were able to find birth year, birthplace,
spouse, children, parents, occupation, and address. Here is what Lucy
and Eliza Ann's profiles looked like on Ancestry.com
