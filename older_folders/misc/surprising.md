The most surprising thing thus far that I have learned through the readings is the fact that Holyoke was a company town, and that the Hadley Falls Company dictated everything from the name of the city, to the urban planning and housing, and to the types of businesses that could enter the area.

I was surprised that the maximum hours worked a week was 72 hours. 

What I've found most surprising is that the patterns and trends that I know about economics and industrial history of the early and middle 20th century plays out in remarkably similar ways in the 19th century.

The most surprising thing that I learned so far in this class was how much potential data analysis that we can do in a time period where we had no electronic data.

They named a whole town after the country of origin of the second person who bought land there. 
Not even "New Ireland."

I was surprised to learn that male Holyoke paper mill workers worked a minimum of fifty-eight hours each week, including working on Saturdays.

The most surprising thing that I have learnt so far is the enormous similarities between the economic structure of the 19th century Holyoke and the 21st century economic structure as I understand it. There are workers who work long hours in companies/factories to make end meet and a few elite investors whose work is to supply capital.
