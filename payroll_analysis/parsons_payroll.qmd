## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

The Parsons Paper Register contains nearly 400 pages of employee, payroll, and financial records from January 1861 to April 1869 from Parsons Paper Company in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Founded in 1853 by Joseph Parsons, Parsons Paper Company was the oldest and largest manufacturer of cotton-based high quality writing papers in Holyoke until its liquidation in 2005.

The original pages of the register, which is now property of the Holyoke Public Library, were scanned on January 10, 2023 as part of this class (STAT210: Mining the History of Holyoke) and screenshots are included in the analysis below. Pages contain information such as employee name and signature, role, days worked, daily pay, and total wages earned, and are organized by separate pay periods. We are focused mainly on the payroll, which is comprised by pages 1-316 of the register.

The goal of the following report is to explore patterns in employment by groups of employees over time by analyzing the payroll records in the 1861-1869 time period, both before and after the end of the Civil War.

In @sec-payperiod we aimed to quantify the length of a single pay period as well as the number of employees working at Parsons Paper Company during the era spanning the register.

The 1860s were a time of great growth for the company, and by the beginning of the Civil War in 1861 Parsons Paper Company had already become the largest manufacturer of writing and envelope paper in the United States.

In @sec-jobs, we examined the distribution of different roles within the company, ranging from women who worked in the "rag room" where the raw material for paper was cut and processed, to men who worked in the engine room and repairs. Most paper mills in the North purchased rags from companies in the South, and Parsons' rag room was considered an "anomaly" [@holyoke:1891].

One of the central goals of this report is to make the information contained in the Parsons Paper Register and related materials more accessible and widely available to those interested in the rich history of Holyoke. A Shiny app is available to view individual scans of the register at [r.amherst.edu/apps/nhorton/Parsons-Paper/](https://r.amherst.edu/apps/nhorton/Parsons-Paper/). We hope that this report can provide some insight into the different day-to-day operations at Parsons Paper Company, as well as the individuals who worked there, many of whom stayed for several years.

In @sec-register analysis below, we used a transcribed copy of page 253 (see Figure 1) of the register to compare the number of employees who were able to sign their own signatures to the number of employees who were not able to on a singular page, and examine whether there was a relationship between literacy and pay. @tbl-example displays the transcript of page 253.

## Analysis of the Register

55% (24/44) of the employees at Parsons Paper Company were illiterate, especially the women and immigrants, who largely lacked formal education. Additionally, employees who were literate received significantly higher wages compared to employees who were illiterate (see Figure 3).

gf_boxplot(total ~ signature_x, data = register) + 
  labs(title = "Parsons Paper Company Employees Wages vs. Literacy (February 1867)", x = "Signed for Payroll", y = "Monthly Total Wages ($)")

```

### How many days in a pay period? {#sec-payperiod}

As mentioned in the introduction, the Parsons Paper Company register stored in the Holyoke Public Library comprises monthly pay periods from January 1861-April 1869 (page 1-316 of the register). Pay periods appear to be a month long with employees typically getting paid on the 1st of the next month. Based off @tbl-example from page 253, most employees work between 20-30 days each pay period, with the average being around 27, so most employees work at least 6 days/week.

In Chapter IV of Constance Green's *Holyoke, Massachusetts: A Case History of the Industrial Revolution in America* [@green:1939], it is reported that male Holyoke paper makers worked 58-72 hours a week. Working 11.25 hours five days a week in addition to 8.75 hours on Saturday was typical for Holyoke textile mills, while women tended to work slightly shorter hours.

Pages 223-225 (see Figure 4) appear to comprise an entire pay period for the month of April in 1867 (most pay periods span 3 pages in the register).

```{r}
#| label: fig4
#| fig.cap: "Page 223 of register (April 1st, 1867), also see pages 224-225 in @sec-appendix."
#| out.width: "75%"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/223.jpeg")
```

Pages 223-225 and pages 261-263 (see Figure 5) are exactly one year apart in the register (April 1st 1867 vs. April 1st 1868).

```{r}
#| label: fig5
#| fig.cap: "Page 261 of register (April 1st, 1868), also see pages 262-263 in @sec-appendix."
#| out.width: "75%"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/261.jpeg")
```

### How many employees during this era?

To quantify this, we counted the number of employees throughout each of the following pay periods by hand by going through the pages of the register one by one. We found that the average number of workers employed at Parsons Paper Company across the measured 9 years spanning the register is **136 employees between 1861-1869**. From @tbl-employees, we can see that the number of employees generally increased over the years, with a noticeable boom in employment towards the end of the Civil War in 1865. In Chapter IV of *Holyoke, Massachusetts: A Case History of the Industrial Revolution in America,* Green mentions that these paper mills had abnormally high employee retention rates compared to other industries. We also know that at the end of 1867, Parsons employed 150 people and had "nineteen engines for grinding rags," turning out "800 tons of paper yearly" (Burt 1867, page 79).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-employees
#| tbl-cap: "Number of Parsons Paper Company Employees by Year Each April."

```

### What types of jobs are there? {#sec-jobs}

In *History of the Connecticut Valley in Massachusetts, with Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Some of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers*, L.H Everts provides more information about the layout of the two Parsons Paper Company mills and the different departments of employment, which helped us determine job names that we could not originally decipher (i.e. "jobber"). Everts writes that,

> "The buildings of this company are situated on the river-bank near the dam, and were built in 1853. They are two in number, the **main mill**, where the paper is made, and what is known as the **finishing-mill**, where it is finished. The former is a structure three stories and a basement high. The upper floor and attic are devoted to drying purposes, while the second story contains the storehouse and **rag-rooms**. About 175 persons are employed on the two floors. On the ground-floor is the **engine-room**, which contains sixteen 450-pound and fourteen 250-pound engines. The mill has three Fourdrinier machines, two of them are 62-inch and the other 72-inch. It has two bleach-boilers, of 3 1/2 and 2 1/2 tons respectively, and 4 sheet calendars and a web calendar and 2 hydraulic presses. The finishing-mill is also situated on the bank of the river, a short distance from the other mill, and, like that, is a brick structure three stories high. The attic and third floor are used for **packing**, and on the second floor the paper is **reeled** and **jogged**. On the first floor are eight 6-roll calendars and three powerful hydraulic presses, and in the basement is a box-factory and plating-machines" (Everts 1879, page 919).

### Tracking employment by job type for first 6 months of the register (Jan-Jun 1861)

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-roles
#| tbl-cap: "Parsons Paper Company Employment by Job Type (January-June 1861)."
employment <- read.csv("parsons_jobs.csv")

employment2 <- employment |>
  select(Month, Year, Page.Number, Job, Count, Monthly.Total.Workers)

# removed notes column when displaying table

kable(employment2, col.names = c("Month", "Year", "Page #", "Job", "Count", "Monthly # Workers")) |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 8) |>
  row_spec(0,bold=TRUE)
```

@tbl-roles displays the different roles recorded for the first six months of the register, from January to June of 1861. The role labels on the register become very sporadic and difficult to track after 1861, however, 'Repairs' and 'Repairs and Watchmen' remain in their own section at the bottom of the register pages throughout all of the pay periods. There were 5 people under "Repairs" for April 1st, 1867 (see Figure 10 in @sec-appendix) and 8 people under April 1st, 1868 (see Figure 11 in @sec-appendix). Refer to @sec-appendix for the link to the full spreadsheet.

The first pages of each pay period are typically comprised of unlabeled laborers (presumably the majority worked in the engine and machine rooms), in addition to Repairs and Watchmen, who are all males. The sorters, stampers, sealers, count and folders, and rag room/cutter roles all appear to remain throughout 1861-1869, although there are much fewer of them compared to the unlabeled male laborers. These roles are largely held by women, and their wages tend to be significantly lower than male workers, which can be seen in the next section.

### How do Parsons wages compare to the Massachusetts state averages?

@tbl-wages and @fig-ggplot7 are adapted from Judith McGaw's *Most Wonderful Machine: Mechanization and Social Change in Berkshire Paper Making, 1801-1885*, (McGaw 1987, page 314), which used data from the *Tenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Statistics of Labor* (Statistics of Labor 1879, page 74).

@tbl-parsons displays weekly wages by job in 1861 for Parsons Paper Company. We calculated the wages by dividing the total wages from the payroll by the number of days worked for that pay period, and then multiplying that number by seven to obtain the weekly wage. The table indicates that Parsons Paper Company employees were, for the most part, paid at comparable rates to other Massachusetts paper factory workers across the state, although the pay for several common roles, especially those held by women (finisher, cutter), is noticeably lower compared to the state average, while other more "important" roles such as engineer and mechanic tended to be paid more at Parsons compared to other Massachusetts paper mills. It may be beneficial to compare the Parsons Paper Company wages to those of other paper mills in Holyoke, as opposed to the entire state, to get a better understanding of how the Parsons Paper Company paid relative to its direct competitors.

  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6)) 
```

From @fig-ggplot8, we can see that the top paying roles at Parsons Paper Company in 1861 were the foreman, followed by repairs and machine room workers, who each made nearly 15 dollars a week. From John Hickey's 1954 University of Massachusetts thesis *The* *Holyoke Area Paper Industry*, we know that repairs were undertaken on Sundays, typically the only day off for many paper workers: "In replacing a wire on a Fourdrinier paper machine, workers in the Holyoke mills receive half a day's pay besides their regular pay during the hours they work on the replacement. This acts as an incentive to the workers to get the machine back in operation as soon as possible" [@hickey:1954, page 94].

In contrast, female laborers who worked in the rag room and as cutters and finishers were paid much lower wages, with almost all women being paid less than 5 dollars a week.

From Hickey's thesis, we also found the following quote:

> "In 1861, after a period of severe readjustment just prior to the Civil War, twenty-one of the thirty-six manufactures of fine papers met at Pittsfield...to organize a protective association. They desired to raise prices which had fallen drastically as the result of a decrease in demand. They agreed to reduce output by about one-third for about three months. This was the first trade association established in the paper industry of the United States....The Parsons Paper Company and the Carew Manufacturing Company were charter members of this organization" [@hickey:1954, page 108].
>
> This agreed upon reduce in output in 1861 is important because it may indicate that at the start of the register, employee wages were lower than they would have been under normal circumstance. Any subsequent change in payment patterns throughout the rest of the 19th century is important for future analysis, as it can indicate both local and domestic economic shocks and sector-specific economic factors."
